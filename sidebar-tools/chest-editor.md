# Chest-Editor

The Chest utility tab is used for editing the contents of \[storage containers\].

The first column is the quantity, the second column is the \[prefix\] and the third column is the item.

Ambiguous prefixes are differentiated as \(A\)ccessory, \(C\)ommon weapon or \(R\)anged weapon prefixes.

**Save** saves any changes you've made to the contents of the chest, but it does _not_ save the world! **Cancel** discards any changes you've made.

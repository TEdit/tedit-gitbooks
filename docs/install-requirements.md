  * 32bit: `Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Terraria\content`
* Steam and Gog versions of Terraria normally work. However, you might be able to get other types to work with the steps below.
* If you don't have Terraria installed on the PC you are using there will be no sprite visualization, but the application should still work if you meet the other requirements.
* If you don't have Terraria installed but have a copy of Terraria/Content e.g. shared network drive, virtual machine, USB drive, etc., you can uncomment and edit `<AltC>` in settings.xml to point to your custom Terraria/Content location.

    NOTE: Remove the `<!--` and `-->` to uncomment the line
